ArchITG is a project aiming to be an installable replacement environment 
for In The Groove arcade cabinets based on ArchLinux. This readme file 
is going to be mostly skeletal since initial work is still being done, 
we've got a long way to go, yet. There will be a todo file and a 
reference file for people to contribute to while I work on initial 
scripts for the install process.
